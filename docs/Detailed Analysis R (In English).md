**Methodology**  
To support this analysis, the following visuals and setups were used:

- *Chart 1: 100% Stacked Column Chart*  
  - Legend: `platform`  
  - X-Axis: `genre`  
  - Y-Axis: `Sum of Global Sales`  
  - Slicer: `year`  

- *Chart 2: Clustered Column Chart*  
  - Legend: `name`  
  - X-Axis: `year`

  - Slicer: `year`

**Global Sales Trend Over Time**  
- Early years saw relatively low sales due to the industry's nascency.  
- **Golden Era (2005â€“2011):** Peak year was **2008** with **678.49 million** units sold.  
- From 2015 onwards, sales declined sharplyâ€”from **264.26 M** in 2015 to **70.87 M** in 2016.  
  This drop is likely linked to the rise of mobile and free-to-play games like *Candy Crush* and *PUBG Mobile*.
