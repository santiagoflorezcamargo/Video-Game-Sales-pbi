## 5. Trends Over Time

![Trends Over Time](../exports/Trends_Over_Time.png)  

**Regional Share of the Global Market**  
- Japan and North America were neck-and-neck for the top spot between 1980 and 1995.  
- From 1996 to 2015, North America led in annual sales every year.  
- Since 1997, Europe overtook Japan and held the second spotâ€”reaching its peak in 2016 with **37.76 %** market share, ahead of North Americaâ€™s **31.97 %**.

**Platform Sales Over Time**  
- The five best-selling platforms of all time launched after the year 2000.  
- PlayStation 2 dominated from 2000 to 2005.  
- In 2006, Nintendo Wii launched and took the top spot that same yearâ€”and again in 2007, 2008, and 2009.  
- Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, released in 2005 and 2006 respectively, took turns leading: Xbox 360 in 2010 and 2015; PS3 from 2011 to 2014.  
- The Nintendo DS, launched in 2004, peaked in 2007 with **298.38 million** units sold.

**Sales Fluctuation of the Four Best-Selling Genres**  
- The peak years for Action, Sports, Shooter, and Role-Playing genres were between **2005â€“2011**, considered the golden age of gaming.  
- Trendlines rise post-2000, influenced by the arrival of PlayStation 2, which in 2005 alone accounted for:  
  - **36.23 %** of Action sales  
  - **37.63 %** of Sports sales  
  - **30.07 %** of Shooter sales  
  - **17.40 %** of Role-Playing sales  
- **Sports** peaked in 2006 and 2009, driven by the success of the Nintendo Wii and titles like *Wii Sports*, *Wii Sports Resort*, and *Wii Fit Plus*.  
- **Shooter** sales surged between 2007 and 2015, thanks to the *Call of Duty* franchise, which consistently ranked in the global top 3.  
- **Role-Playing** began trending upward as early as 1996 due to *PokÃ©mon*â€™s explosion in popularity.  
- **Action** hit its highest point in 2009, not because of a single blockbuster, but a wide variety of well-performing titles.

**Methodology**  
To support this analysis, the following visuals and setups were used:

- *Chart 1: 100% Stacked Column Chart*  
  - Legend: `platform`  
  - X-Axis: `genre`  
  - Y-Axis: `Sum of Global Sales`  
  - Slicer: `year`  

- *Chart 2: Clustered Column Chart*  
  - Legend: `name`  
  - X-Axis: `year`  
  - Y-Axis: `Sum of Global Sales`  
  - Slicer: `year`

**Global Sales Trend Over Time**  
- Early years saw relatively low sales due to the industry's nascency.  
- **Golden Era (2005â€“2011):** Peak year was **2008** with **678.49 million** units sold.  
- From 2015 onwards, sales declined sharplyâ€”from **264.26 M** in 2015 to **70.87 M** in 2016.  
  This drop is likely linked to the rise of mobile and free-to-play games like *Candy Crush* and *PUBG Mobile*.

  ## 6. Variability & Outliers  
![Variability & Outliers](../exports/Variability_Outliers.png)  

**Sales Correlation: North America vs. Japan**  
- The points are scattered and do not follow a clear linear pattern, indicating **little to no correlation** between sales in North America and Japan.  
- Some games were **massive in Japan** but underwhelming in North America (*e.g., PokÃ©mon Red/Blue, PokÃ©mon Diamond/Pearl*), while others did well only in North America (*e.g., Duck Hunt, Wii Sports*).  
- **Cultural preferences** likely play a major role â€” Japanese audiences tend to favor **Role-Playing** games, whereas North American audiences show broader tastes with a strong lean toward the **Shooter** genre.

**Sales Correlation: North America vs. Europe**  
- Sales in North America and Europe exhibit a **stronger correlation**, with most points clustered around the trendline.  
- The general pattern shows **similar market preferences**, where success in one region often mirrors success in the other.

**Sales Correlation: North America vs. Rest of World**  
- The correlation here is **moderate** â€” stronger than with Japan, but **weaker than with Europe**.  
- The chart contains **more outliers**, including *Duck Hunt*, which appears as an anomaly in all three comparisons â€” suggesting it was primarily a **North American phenomenon**.  
- Once again, cultural differences are a likely factor. While **North America favors Shooters**, regions like Japan lean towards **Role-Playing and Platform** titles.

**Sales Distribution by Genre**  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** 658.83  
- **Total Range:** 1549.45  
- The IQR represents **42.46 %** of the total range, indicating **high central dispersion** in genre sales.  
- There are **no outliers** in the genre distribution â€” even the top-selling genre (*Action*, with 1722.48M) falls within expected variability.  
- **Mean:** 735.03 | **Median:** 762.19  
- The **slightly lower mean** suggests the presence of **lower-selling genres** pulling the average down.

**Sales Distribution by Platform**  
- There are **6 outlier points** â€” platforms with exceptionally high sales (e.g., 1233.46M, 969.61M), well above the upper whisker.  
- **Mean:** 284.53 | **Median:** 200.05  
- The **significant gap** between the mean and median indicates a **right-skewed distribution** due to blockbuster platforms like **PS2** and **X360**.  
- **75 % of platforms** sold **â‰¤ 284.90M**, highlighting the dominance of a few market leaders over a broad base of underperformers.

**Sales Distribution by Publisher & Genre**  
- Some publishers achieved **genre-level sales outliers**, especially in **Action, Sports**, and **Shooter**.  
- **Sony Computer Entertainment** shows a **symmetric distribution** with mean â‰ˆ median and an IQR that covers **70 % of the total range**, suggesting a **well-balanced sales performance**.  
- Other publishers (e.g., Nintendo, EA) have a **mean significantly higher than the median**, pointing to **skewed distributions** driven by **massive hits**.
